              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  i liked the film , one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner . xxmaj fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack . xxmaj the overall idea is original , and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner . xxmaj acting is quite good , with xxmaj mark xxmaj wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately , and xxmaj jennifer xxmaj aniston in tune with the nice - girl - who - knows - a - lot - about - life role . xxmaj more problematic is the ending , which is quite conventional , and may disappoint . xxmaj it looks like the main character after xxunk the big and famous band has found his own creative path . xxmaj however , in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie ! \n",

              "  xxmaj set somewhere around the same time as the movie ( or at all ) , the story circles around the only xxmaj black sheriff in the wild west , named appropriately ' xxmaj black ' xxmaj bart , who is this time played by future xxmaj academy xxmaj award winner xxmaj louis xxmaj gossett xxmaj jr. , obviously before his stint in \" real \" acting , whereas in this he is playing a \" g - rated \" xxmaj richard xxmaj pryor . xxmaj most of the other characters are carbon ( if not , really bad ) copies of the characters in the movie : xxmaj jim , xxmaj the xxmaj waco xxmaj kid is replaced by a similar looking character named xxmaj reb xxmaj jordan , a former xxmaj confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . xxmaj lilian xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk is now xxmaj belle xxmaj xxunk , a more of a ripoff of the character being that she 's a show dancer and a xxmaj german with a xxmaj marlene xxmaj dietrich - type accent and personality . xxmaj while that 's pretty much the end in similarities , xxmaj the lead \" bad guy \" in the story is xxmaj fern xxmaj xxunk , played by xxmaj noble xxmaj willingham , who i assumed would 've been xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lamar if xxmaj warner xxmaj bros. secured the rights to the name ( xxmaj see trivia for \" xxmaj blazing xxmaj saddles \" ) and his son xxmaj curley ... i dunno , xxmaj xxunk i suppose ? xxmaj the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom , much less a pilot . xxmaj bart deals with the mayor 's drunk son and he 's out - of - control behavior which has caused the town to spin . xxmaj really , it 's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the \" series \" and does n't focus on the variety and context that would make this an \" alright \" show . i ca n't really call it a sitcom ( and even if i wanted to ) and that 's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at xxmaj warner xxmaj bros. xxmaj studios and later added a laugh track , so the show is set up almost exactly like \" xxup m*a*s*h \" ( complete with a bland and dull \" laughing \" that is identical to the series ) . xxmaj the acting is so - so , but there 's one part that always make me laugh , and that 's when the actor playing xxmaj reb xxmaj jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue . xxup ha ! xxmaj the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie ( xxmaj surprisingly , they use the word \" xxmaj xxunk \" numerous amount of times through a xxunk episode , rather touchy for it 's time period and even for today ) and it gets repetitive . \n",

              "  i liked the film , one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner . xxmaj fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack . xxmaj the overall idea is original , and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner . xxmaj acting is quite good , with xxmaj mark xxmaj wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics i saw him lately , and xxmaj jennifer xxmaj aniston in tune with the nice - girl - who - knows - a - lot - about - life role . xxmaj more problematic is the ending , which is quite conventional , and may disappoint . xxmaj it looks like the main character after xxunk the big and famous band has found his own creative path . xxmaj however , in an ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie ! \n",

              "  8 / 10 on my personal scale . xxmaj worth seeing - however , expect exposure to a high dose of metal . xxmaj if you do not like this kind of music , you may chose to avoid this film .,xxbos xxmaj this is a pale imitation of ' xxmaj officer and a xxmaj gentleman . ' xxmaj there is xxup no chemistry between xxmaj kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest . xxmaj the dialog is wooden , the situations hackneyed . xxmaj it 's too long and the climax is anti - climactic ( ! ) . i love the xxup uscg , its men and women are fearless and tough . xxmaj the action scenes are awesome , but this movie does n't do much for recruiting , i fear . xxmaj the script is formulaic , but confusing . xxmaj kutcher 's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that was n't his fault ? xxmaj costner 's is raging against the dying of the light , but why ? xxmaj his ' conflict ' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle . i saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt i got my money 's worth .,xxbos xxmaj the three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless xxmaj chaplin classics , nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either . xxmaj chaplin 's score for these films and the framework added as xxunk sections between the shorts are also well done . xxmaj the problem with this compilation is a minor one , yet annoying . xxmaj the shorts have been stretch - printed to fit the 24 frame p.s . speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s . xxmaj this results is jerky motion that does n't look very attractive , and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time , it 's just not excusable that the current xxup dvd version is xxunk , the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed . xxmaj there are separate restored versions of these classics available , even on xxup dvd , and it would not be a problem to restore the image , but alas this has not been done . \n",
